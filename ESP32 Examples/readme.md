# ESP32 Examples #

A few examples of systems this app could be integrated into.

* esp_mandel_ble: draws mandelbrot sets, rgb channel saturation and other factors are controllable from the app.
* ESP32_BLE_UART_Demo: example app for UART i/o
* BLE_MIDI_Packer: reads in channel and value and packs it into MIDI commands; these are sent out over Serial. In conjunction with the app this can be used as a simulated MIDI controller for a variety of electronic music applications.
